# Programming Paradigms #

This repository contains the projects and assignments developed as part of the Programming Paradigms course. The course explores various programming paradigms, including functional, imperative, object-oriented, and declarative programming. Key topics covered include:

- Understanding the principles and characteristics of different programming paradigms
- Implementing algorithms and data structures using multiple paradigms
- Exploring functional programming concepts through languages like OCaml and Scala
- Analyzing the trade-offs and advantages of each paradigm in software development
- Comparing and contrasting approaches to problem-solving across paradigms

In this repository, you will find code examples, exercises, and documentation that illustrate the concepts learned throughout the course. The aim is to deepen understanding of programming paradigms and enhance the ability to choose the appropriate paradigm for various programming tasks.
